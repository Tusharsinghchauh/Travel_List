### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tusharsinghchauh/Travel_List.git
   cd Travel_List
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action! 🎉


## 🛠️ Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. The page will reload when you make changes, and you'll see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Perfect for ensuring your code quality as you develop.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need full control over the build configuration, you can `eject` at any time.
